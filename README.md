-------------------------------------------------------------------
A comprehensive car price prediction system using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The model is built using sklearn's Linear Regression with **92%** accuracy and saved with pickle. The front-end interface is created using Streamlit, enabling users to input car features and get accurate price predictions.
